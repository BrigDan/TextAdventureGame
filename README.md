_What is this project?_

This project was a way for me and @TiledmMan to create something that we both love, video games and turn it into a creative project where we learn how to create the different fundemental parts of a game using object oriented python. In short, this was a way for us to learn OOP programming,
and we recommend you do it too!

_Will it ever be made into a complete game?_

Most likely not, I wouldn't even call it a game at its current state. While it was a good project we realized halfway through that as a game this would work better in other languages and that we learnt everything we could from it.
